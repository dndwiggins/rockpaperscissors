Hey Viewer! Here is a very simple Rock Paper Scissors game to practice DOM maniuplation and JS syntax.
This kind of programming is unlike any styles that I did with Java and C.
Took me a while to figure out my main bug which was letting the DOM load first before adding any event listeners.
Cheers and Happy Hacking!
